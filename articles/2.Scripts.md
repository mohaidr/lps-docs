### Scripts in the LPS Tool

The LPS tool leverages **YAML-based scripts** to define test plans, including rounds, iterations, variables, environments, and HTTP requests. These scripts provide a flexible and human-readable way to configure load, performance, and stress tests.

---

### Key Components of a Script
1. **Name**: The test plan name.
2. **Variables**: Global or environment-specific variables used in the test.
3. **Environments**: Configurable settings for different testing contexts (e.g., production, staging).
4. **Rounds**: Sequential test execution blocks.
5. **Iterations**: Individual HTTP request configurations within a round.
6. **HTTP Requests**: Define the method, URL, headers, and payload.

### Example Script Structure
```yaml
name: MyTestPlan
variables:
- to: apiUrl
  value: https://api.example.com
rounds:
- name: LoadTestRound
  numberOfClients: 10
  iterations:
  - name: GetResource
    httpRequest:
      url: $apiUrl/resource
      httpMethod: GET
      saveResponse: true
    mode: R
    requestCount: 100
environments:
- name: production
  variables:
  - name: apiUrl
    value: https://api.prod.example.com
```

### Limitations
1. **Field Names**:
   - All field names in the YAML script must follow **CamelCase** conventions.
   - Using incorrect cases (e.g., `snake_case` or `PascalCase`) will cause serialization to fail.
   
   **Example of Incorrect Field Names**:
   ```yaml
   name: MyTestPlan  # Incorrect
   VARIABLES: []     # Incorrect
   ```

   **Correct Field Names**:
   ```yaml
   name: MyTestPlan
   variables: []
   ```

2. **Mandatory Fields**:
   - Certain fields (e.g., `name`, `rounds`) are required for the script to run successfully.

3. **Indentation**:
   - YAML scripts are indentation-sensitive. Incorrect indentation can lead to parsing errors.

4. **Type Validation**:
   - Ensure the data types (e.g., `string`, `integer`) for fields are valid.

---

### Recommended Practices
1. **Consistency**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions for fields and variables.
   
2. **Validation**:
   - Validate scripts using a YAML linter before execution.
   
3. **Comments**:
   - Add comments for clarity and maintainability.
   ```yaml
   # Define variables
   variables:
   - to: apiUrl
     value: https://api.example.com
   ```

This document emphasizes the importance of adhering to YAML syntax and **CamelCase** conventions to ensure the LPS tool processes the scripts correctly.
