# Dashboard in LPS Tool

The **LPS Tool** features a modern and intuitive dashboard designed to help users efficiently monitor and analyze essential metrics for their testing endpoints. This built-in dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for real-time insights into testing performance.

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**:  
   The dashboard updates dynamically to reflect the current state of testing, displaying essential metrics in an organized and accessible way.

2. **Comprehensive Metrics**:  
   The dashboard tracks and displays a variety of critical metrics to help users evaluate the performance of their endpoints.

3. **Built-In Configuration**:  
   The dashboard can be enabled or disabled through the global configuration file (`config/lpsSettings.json`). This flexibility is particularly useful when integrating with DevOps tools or custom workflows.

4. **REST API Support**:  
   Even when the built-in dashboard is disabled, the REST API remains functional, allowing users to fetch metrics programmatically.

## Metrics Displayed in the Dashboard

### Response Breakdown Metrics
- **HttpStatusCode**: The status code of HTTP responses (e.g., `200` for success).
- **HttpStatusReason**: The reason phrase for the status code (e.g., `OK`).
- **Count**: The number of responses for each status code.

### Response Time Metrics
- **SumResponseTime**: Total response time for all requests (in milliseconds).
- **AverageResponseTime**: Average response time for requests (in milliseconds).
- **MinResponseTime**: Minimum response time recorded (in milliseconds).
- **MaxResponseTime**: Maximum response time recorded (in milliseconds).
- **P90ResponseTime**: 90th percentile response time (in milliseconds).
- **P50ResponseTime**: 50th percentile (median) response time (in milliseconds).
- **P10ResponseTime**: 10th percentile response time (in milliseconds).

### Connection Metrics
- **RequestsRate**: Rate of requests per second.
- **RequestsRatePerCoolDownPeriod**: Rate of requests per cooldown periods.
- **RequestsCount**: Total number of requests sent.
- **ActiveRequestsCount**: Number of currently active requests.
- **SuccessfulRequestCount**: Number of successful requests.
- **FailedRequestsCount**: Number of failed requests.

### Data Transmission Metrics
- **DataSent**: Total amount of data sent (in bytes).
- **DataReceived**: Total amount of data received (in bytes).
- **AverageDataSent**: Average amount of data sent per request (in bytes).
- **AverageDataReceived**: Average amount of data received per request (in bytes).
- **AverageDataSentPerSecond**: Average data sent per second (in bytes per second).
- **AverageDataReceivedPerSecond**: Average data received per second (in bytes per second).
- **AverageBytesPerSecond**: Total average data throughput (in bytes per second).

## Save Reports
The LPS dashboard allows you to download your dashboard results as a PDF report for future analysis.

## Configuring the Dashboard
The dashboard can be configured through the `config/lpsSettings.json` file under the `LPSDashboardConfiguration` section. Below is an example configuration:

```json
"LPSDashboardConfiguration": {
  "BuiltInDashboard": true,
  "Port": 8009,
  "RefreshRate": 5
}
```

### Configuration Options
- **BuiltInDashboard**: Enables (`true`) or disables (`false`) the built-in dashboard.
- **Port**: Specifies the port on which the dashboard runs (default: `8009`).
- **RefreshRate**: Determines how often the dashboard refreshes (in seconds).

## Disabling the Dashboard
The built-in dashboard can be disabled without affecting the REST API. This is useful for scenarios like integrating with DevOps pipelines or running tests in environments where a dashboard UI is not required.

Example:
```json
"LPSDashboardConfiguration": {
  "BuiltInDashboard": false,
  "Port": 8009,
  "RefreshRate": 5
}
```

## Example Configuration File

```json
{
  "LPSAppSettings": {
    "LPSFileLoggerConfiguration": {
      "LogFilePath": "logs/lpslog.log",
      "ConsoleLogingLevel": 1,
      "EnableConsoleLogging": true,
      "DisableConsoleErrorLogging": true,
      "DisableFileLogging": false,
      "LoggingLevel": 0
    },
    "LPSWatchdogConfiguration": {
      "MaxMemoryMB": 1000,
      "CoolDownMemoryMB": 700,
      "MaxCPUPercentage": 70,
      "CoolDownCPUPercentage": 50,
      "CoolDownRetryTimeInSeconds": 1,
      "MaxConcurrentConnectionsCountPerHostName": 3000,
      "CoolDownConcurrentConnectionsCountPerHostName": 2500,
      "MaxCoolingPeriod": 60,
      "ResumeCoolingAfter": 60,
      "SuspensionMode": 0
    },
    "LPSHttpClientConfiguration": {
      "ClientTimeoutInSeconds": 300,
      "PooledConnectionLifeTimeInSeconds": 1500,
      "PooledConnectionIdleTimeoutInSeconds": 350,
      "MaxConnectionsPerServer": 3000
    },
    "LPSDashboardConfiguration": {
      "BuiltInDashboard": true,
      "Port": 8009,
      "RefreshRate": 5
    }
  }
}
```

The LPS Dashboard is an integral tool for visualizing and analyzing test performance metrics, offering both flexibility and ease of use for testers and developers.
