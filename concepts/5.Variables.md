# Using Variables in LPS

Variables enhance the flexibility of test scenarios by allowing dynamic data to be injected into requests. They can be predefined or generated during the test and are useful for:
- Storing values captured from responses.
- Referencing external data sources like CSV files or JSON configurations.
- Creating parameterized test cases.
- To use a defined variable use $variable name, for complex placeholders use ${}. For example ${csvData[0,$loopcounter(start=0, end=10)]}

### Example
```yaml
name: variablesTest
variables:
- name: responseTime
  value: $randomnumber(min=100, max=500)
rounds:
- name: VariableExampleRound
  numberOfClients: 2
  arrivalDelay: 5000
  iterations:
  - name: UseVariable
    mode: R
    requestCount: 200
    httpRequest:
      url: https://example.com/resource/$responseTime
      httpMethod: GET
```
