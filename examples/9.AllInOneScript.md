## 🧩 Overview
The **`SecureDataExample`** plan demonstrates many of the advanced capabilities of the **LPS tool** in one scenario.  

It simulates a **secure data-fetching workflow** where:
1. Tokens are fetched from an authentication endpoint.  
2. Those tokens are used to retrieve paginated data from a protected API.  
3. The test runs under specific conditions, with failure criteria and termination rules.

## 🔧 Variables Section

### Defined Variables

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **`baseUrl`** | Base URL for the API requests (e.g., `https://example.com`). |
| **`tokenEndpoint`** | Built dynamically using `${baseUrl}` → `https://example.com/auth/token`. |
| **`dataEndpoint`** | Built dynamically as `${baseUrl}/data`. |
| **`csvData`** | Reads data from a CSV file located at `data/users.csv`. The `as: csv` means it will be parsed into rows and columns. |
| **`number`** | A numeric variable with value `10`, explicitly typed as integer. |

🧠 The `$read()` function demonstrates how LPS can pull external data into tests.

---

## 🔁 Rounds Section

### **Round Name:** `SecureDataRound`

This round represents a complete test phase.

| Property | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **`numberOfClients`** | 100 virtual users simulate concurrent clients. |
| **`arrivalDelay`** | Each client starts after a 100 ms delay to avoid simultaneous starts. |
| **`runInParallel`** | `false` means that the iterations will run sequentially. |

---

### **Iteration 1: `FetchToken`**

Simulates a login or token retrieval request.

**Details:**
- Sends a **POST** request to `$tokenEndpoint`.
- Uses dynamic credentials pulled from the CSV file:
  ```yaml
  "client_id": "$users[$counter(counter=namesCounter, start=0, reset=5),1]",
  "client_secret": "$users[$counter(counter=passwordsCounter, start=0, reset=5),2]"
  ```
  - `$counter` cycles through CSV rows.
  - `start=0` → starts from row 0.
  - `reset=5` → after 5 cycles, it resets.
  - `[ ,1]` → refers to column index 1.

- The request body is JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`.
- The response is captured into a variable called `authResponse` as `qjson` (quoted JSON).

---

### **Iteration 2: `GetData`**

Fetches protected data **only if the token is valid**.

**Key condition:**
```yaml
skipIf: '${authResponse.Body.access_token} = "" or $authResponse.StatusCode <>200'
```

- Prevents running this iteration if:
  - The token (`access_token`) is empty, or  
  - The request failed (`StatusCode` not equal to 200).  

💡 Note: Placeholders containing underscores or any special character like (`_`) must be wrapped with `${}`.

---

### **Iteration 3: `GetPaginatedData`**

Tests repeated (looped) requests under certain conditions.

| Property | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **`mode: R`** | “Repeat” mode — repeats requests multiple times. |
| **`requestCount: 10`** | Each client sends 10 repeated requests. |
| **`skipIf`** | Same condition as before (skip if token invalid). |
| **`httpRequest.url`** | Adds a page number using `$counter` with step increments of 20. |
| **`failureCriteria`** | Defines when requests are considered failed (error codes 403, 401, 500; error rate > 30%). |
| **`terminationRules`** | Defines **live stop conditions** during execution. |

#### Termination Rules

1. **Error-based rule**
   - If errors (403, 401, 500) exceed **30%** for **3 continuous seconds**, the iteration stops.

2. **Latency-based rule**
   - If **P90 latency** (90th percentile response time) exceeds **400 ms** for **10 continuous seconds**, the iteration stops.

These rules are continuously monitored by the **master node**.

---

## 🌐 Environments Section

Defines environment-specific overrides.

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **`environment`** | Marks this environment as `"production"`. |
| **`baseUrl`** | Overrides the base URL to `https://example.com`. |

✅ This allows running the same plan across environments (staging, production, etc.) just by switching the flag.

---

## 🚀 Run Command
```bash
lps run SecureDataExample.yaml --environment production
```
Executes the test plan using the **production** environment variables.

---

## 🧠 Summary

| Concept | Demonstrated Feature |
|----------|----------------------|
| Variables | Basic, dynamic, environment-specific, and from CSV. |
| Loops | `$counter()` for cycling through CSV rows or paginated requests. |
| Capture | Store response data into variables for later use. |
| Conditional Execution | `skipIf` to skip iterations based on runtime logic. |
| Metrics & Termination | Failure criteria and real-time termination rules. |
| Environments | Override variables cleanly per environment. |

---

### 🏁 In Short
This example simulates **logging in with multiple user credentials**, **fetching secure data**, and **paging through results** — all while automatically stopping when error or performance thresholds are breached.  

It demonstrates how **LPS dynamically controls test behavior** using variables, metrics, and intelligent execution rules.
