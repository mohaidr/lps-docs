# LPS Tool Advanced Payload and File Handling Examples

This document demonstrates how to utilize the `read` utility to design dynamic load patterns.

## 1. How to Read a CSV File and Use Its Items
```yaml
name: ReadCSVExample
variables:
- name: csvData
  value: $read(path=../data/sample.csv)
  as: csv
rounds:
- name: ReadCSVRound
  numberOfClients: 5
  arrivalDelay: 3000
  iterations:
  - name: UseCSVItem
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/resource/${csvData[0,0]}
      httpMethod: GET
    mode: R
    requestCount: 1
```
**Purpose**: Reads a CSV file and uses the first item (`[0,0]`) in the dataset as part of the URL.

---

## 2. How to Read a CSV File and Use Its Items with `counter`
```yaml
name: LoopCSVWithCounter
variables:
- name: csvData
  value: $read(path=../data/sample.csv)
  as: csv
rounds:
- name: CSVCounterRound
  numberOfClients: 5
  arrivalDelay: 3000
  iterations:
  - name: UseCSVLoop
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/resource/${csvData[$counter(start=0, end=9),0]}
      httpMethod: GET
    mode: R
    requestCount: 10
```
**Purpose**: Uses a `counter` to read a new item from the CSV file for each request, iterates over the first column of each row in the first 10 rows of the CSV file.

## 3. How to Read a JSON File and Use Its Items
```yaml
name: ReadJSONExample
variables:
- name: jsonData
  value: $read(path=../data/sample.json)
  as: json
rounds:
- name: ReadJSONRound
  numberOfClients: 5
  arrivalDelay: 3000
  iterations:
  - name: UseJSONItem
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/resource/${jsonData.property}
      httpMethod: GET
    mode: R
    requestCount: 1
```
**Purpose**: Reads a JSON file and uses a property (`property`) in the request.

---

## 4. How to Read an XML File and Use Its Items
```yaml
name: ReadXMLExample
variables:
- name: xmlData
  value: $read(path=../data/sample.xml)
  as: xml
rounds:
- name: ReadXMLRound
  numberOfClients: 5
  arrivalDelay: 3000
  iterations:
  - name: UseXMLItem
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/resource/${xmlData/root/items/item[1]/subitem}
      httpMethod: GET
    mode: R
    requestCount: 1
```
**Purpose**: Reads an XML file and accesses nested elements (`item/subitem`) for the request.

---

## 5. How to Read a Token from an Environment Variable
```yaml
name: ReadTokenFromEnv
variables:
- name: authToken
  value: $read(source=env, name=API_TOKEN)
rounds:
- name: EnvTokenRound
  numberOfClients: 1
  arrivalDelay: 1000
  iterations:
  - name: UseEnvToken
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/secure
      httpMethod: GET
      headers:
        Authorization: Bearer ${authToken}
    mode: R
    requestCount: 1
```
**Purpose**: Reads a token from the environment variable `API_TOKEN` and uses it as a Bearer token in the request header.

---

## 6. How to Copy a Token from Another Variable
```yaml
name: ReadTokenFromVariable
variables:
- name: baseToken
  value: my-static-token
- name: authToken
  value: $read(source=variable, name=baseToken)
rounds:
- name: VariableTokenRound
  numberOfClients: 1
  arrivalDelay: 1000
  iterations:
  - name: UseVariableToken
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/secure
      httpMethod: GET
      headers:
        Authorization: Bearer ${authToken}
    mode: R
    requestCount: 1
```
**Purpose**: Reads a token from another variable (`baseToken`) and reuses it under a new variable (`authToken`).
