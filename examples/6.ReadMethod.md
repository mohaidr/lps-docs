# LPS Tool Advanced Payload and File Handling Examples

This document demonstrates how to utilize the read utility to design dynamic load patterns

## 1. How to Read a CSV File and Use Its Items
```yaml
name: ReadCSVExample
variables:
- name: csvData
  value: $read(path=../data/sample.csv)
  as: csv
rounds:
- name: ReadCSVRound
  numberOfClients: 1
  iterations:
  - name: UseCSVItem
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/resource/$csvData[0,0]
      httpMethod: GET
    mode: R
    requestCount: 1
```
**Purpose**: Reads a CSV file and uses the first item (`[0,0]`) in the dataset as part of the URL.

## 2. How to Read a CSV File and Use Its Items with `loopcounter`
```yaml
name: ReadCSVWithLoopCounter
variables:
- name: csvData
  value: $read(path=../data/sample.csv)
  as: csv
rounds:
- name: CSVLoopCounterRound
  numberOfClients: 1
  iterations:
  - name: UseCSVLoop
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/resource/${csvData[$loopcounter(start=0, end=9),0]}
      httpMethod: GET
    mode: R
    requestCount: 10
```
**Purpose**: Uses a `loopcounter` to read a new item from the CSV file for each request, iterates over the first column of each row in the first 10 rows of the CSV file.

## 3. How to Read a JSON File and Use Its Items
```yaml
name: ReadJSONExample
variables:
- name: jsonData
  value: $read(path=../data/sample.json)
  as: json
rounds:
- name: ReadJSONRound
  numberOfClients: 1
  iterations:
  - name: UseJSONItem
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/resource/$jsonData.property
      httpMethod: GET
    mode: R
    requestCount: 1
```
**Purpose**: Reads a JSON file and uses a property (`property`) in the request.

---

## 4. How to Read an XML File and Use Its Items
```yaml
name: ReadXMLExample
variables:
- name: xmlData
  value: $read(path=../data/sample.xml)
  as: xml
rounds:
- name: ReadXMLRound
  numberOfClients: 1
  iterations:
  - name: UseXMLItem
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/resource/${xmlData/item/subitem}
      httpMethod: GET
    mode: R
    requestCount: 1
```
**Purpose**: Reads an XML file and accesses nested elements (`item/subitem`) for the request.
