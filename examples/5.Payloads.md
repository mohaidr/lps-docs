# Examples of Binary, Multipart, and Raw Payload Handling

### 1. Binary Payload Example
```yaml
name: BinaryPayloadExample
rounds:
- name: BinaryPayloadRound
  numberOfClients: 5
  arrivalDelay: 3000
  iterations:
  - name: BinaryPayloadIteration
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/upload
      httpMethod: POST
      payload:
        file: ../data/binaryfile.bin
    mode: R
    requestCount: 1
```
**Purpose**: Sends a binary file as the payload. The type is automatically detected based on the file.

### 2. Multipart Payload Example
```yaml
name: MultipartPayloadExample
rounds:
- name: MultipartPayloadRound
  numberOfClients: 5
  arrivalDelay: 3000
  iterations:
  - name: MultipartPayloadIteration
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/upload
      httpMethod: POST
      payload:
        multipart:
          fields:
            - name: field1
              value: sample value
              contentType: text/plain
            - name: field2
              value: another value
              contentType: application/json
          files:
            - name: file1
              path: ../data/image.jpg
              contentType: image/jpeg
            - name: file2
              path: ../data/document.pdf
              contentType: application/pdf
    mode: R
    requestCount: 1
```
**Purpose**: Demonstrates how to send multipart payloads with both text fields and files.

### 3. Raw Payload Example
```yaml
name: RawPayloadExample
rounds:
- name: RawPayloadRound
  numberOfClients: 5
  arrivalDelay: 3000
  iterations:
  - name: RawPayloadIteration
    httpRequest:
      url: https://api.example.com/data
      httpMethod: POST
      payload:
        type: Raw
        raw: |
          {
            "key1": "value1",
            "key2": "value2",
            "nested": {
              "key3": "value3"
            }
          }
    mode: R
    requestCount: 1
```
**Purpose**: Sends raw JSON data in the request payload. This is useful for API endpoints requiring structured payloads like JSON or XML.
